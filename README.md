# Job-Automator-V2

## Overview
Job-Automator-V2 is a sophisticated web scraping application designed to efficiently scrape job listings from various websites. It is built with flexibility and adaptability in mind, allowing it to handle multiple websites and frequent updates. The application employs advanced techniques to bypass anti-bot measures, ensuring reliable and continuous scraping operations.

## Features
- **Multi-Website Scraping**: Capable of scraping job listings from various popular job boards.
- **Robust Anti-Bot Mechanisms**: Utilizes advanced techniques to evade anti-bot measures and ensure uninterrupted scraping.
- **Extensible and Configurable**: Easily configurable to add new websites and update scraping logic.
- **Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring**: Implements detailed logging and real-time monitoring to maintain application health and performance.
- **Scalability and Parallelism**: Supports running multiple scrapers in parallel for increased efficiency and speed.

## Note on Ethical Considerations
This project was initially created for personal use to automate job applications. However, to maintain ethical standards and avoid potential concerns, certain AI-related components have been removed from the public repository. The remaining components, such as anti-bot mechanisms and form handlers, are intended for educational purposes only.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-automator-v2.git
    cd job-automator-v2
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup Configuration**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the required environment variables:
      ```plaintext
      NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_api_key
      NOTION_DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
      RATE_LIMIT=10
      SCRAPER_TYPE=puppeteer
      ANTIBOT_MECHANISM=puppeteerExtra
      LOGGING_LEVEL=info
      ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    node src/main/app.js
    ```

## Configuration
The application supports global and website-specific configurations. Configuration settings are managed through JSON files and environment variables. Key configuration options include:
- **scraper**: The type of scraper to use (e.g., Puppeteer).
- **antiBotMechanism**: The anti-bot mechanism to use (e.g., Puppeteer-extra).
- **rateLimit**: Sets the rate limit for requests.
- **monitoring**: Configuration for enabling and setting up monitoring.

### Example Configuration (config.json)
```json
{
  "scraper": "puppeteer",
  "antiBotMechanism": "puppeteerExtra",
  "rateLimit": 10,
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "loggingLevel": "info"
  },
  "websites": [
    {
      "name": "Indeed",
      "configFile": "indeedConfig.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "LinkedIn",
      "configFile": "linkedinConfig.json"
    },
    {
      "name": "Glassdoor",
      "configFile": "glassdoorConfig.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
node src/main/app.js
```

To run a scraper for a specific website, specify the website configuration in the command line:
```bash
node src/main/app.js --config=config/indeedConfig.json
```

## Development
### Adding a New Scraper
1. **Create Scraper Module**: Implement a new scraper module in the `scrapers` directory.
2. **Update Scraper Factory**: Add logic to the scraper factory to include the new scraper.
3. **Configure**: Update the configuration files to support the new scraper.

### Adding a New Anti-Bot Mechanism
1. **Create Anti-Bot Module**: Implement a new anti-bot mechanism in the `anti-bot` directory.
2. **Update Anti-Bot Factory**: Add logic to the anti-bot factory to include the new mechanism.
3. **Configure**: Update the configuration files to support the new anti-bot mechanism.

### Error Logging and Monitoring
The application includes comprehensive logging and monitoring features to ensure stability and performance. Error logs capture detailed information about failures, and monitoring tools track the application's health.

### Example Logging Configuration (logger.js)
```javascript
const winston = require('winston');

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/error/error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/combined/combined.log' })
  ]
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  logger.add(new winston.transports.Console({
    format: winston.format.simple()
  }));
}

module.exports = logger;
```

### Example Monitoring (monitor.js)
```javascript
const logger = require('./logger');

function monitorPerformance() {
  // Implement monitoring logic here
  setInterval(() => {
    // Check application health
    logger.info('Monitoring application performance...');
  }, 60000);
}

module.exports = monitorPerformance;
```
